👋 Hello there! I'm Chi Hung, Wong. You can call me Hugo. Originally from the vibrant city of Hong Kong, I've found myself embracing the dynamic energy of Toronto.

🚀 I thrive on turning ideas into reality through code and innovation. With a background spanning Quality Assurance (QA) and Business Analysis (BA), I'm constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to broaden my skill set and solve complex problems.

💻 My journey in the world of programming kicked off during my early days as a QA assistant post-graduation, and it's been an exhilarating ride ever since. Programming Languages: PostgreSQL, Python Frameworks: Agile/ scrum methodologies, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), UX Tools: Microsoft Office, Visio, Jira, Confluence, Figma, Power BI, Tableau

🌟 Some of my key strengths include my ability to effectively analyze complex problems, streamline processes, and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I excel in Agile/Scrum methodologies, where my proactive approach and attention to detail ensure successful project outcomes. Additionally, my strong background in QA and BA allows me to bridge the gap between technical and business requirements, facilitating seamless collaboration within cross-functional teams. I'm passionate about continuous learning and always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skills.

🔧 When I'm not engrossed in lines of code, you'll likely find me indulging in Toronto's diverse culinary offerings, experimenting with flavors in my kitchen, or getting lost in the pages of a captivating book.
